/**
 * Stripe Middleware
 *
 * Middleware to initialize Stripe service for billing routes.
 * Eliminates the need to call initializeStripe() in every handler.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Centralized Stripe initialization
 * - Reduces code duplication
 * - Follows established middleware patterns
 * - Easier to mock for testing

 * Usage:

 * app.use('/billing/*', ensureStripeInitialized);
 * ```
